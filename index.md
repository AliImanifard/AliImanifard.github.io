## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">
I am a Master’s student in Computer Science, ranked <strong>1st out of 100+ students</strong> in my cohort for two consecutive years. I have maintained a <strong>perfect GPA of 20.00/20.00 (maximum score)</strong> throughout my master’s program to date. During the final 18 months of my undergraduate studies, I also ranked first in my class. My research focuses on <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and AI Agents</strong>. I have authored <strong>13+ academic publications</strong>, including  work recognized with <strong>two IEEE Best Paper Awards</strong>. In 2024, one of my papers received <strong>1st place out of 150 submissions</strong> at IEEE SGC. Over the past two years, I have worked as both a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> and <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong>, supporting various faculty members in research and instruction. Notably, I had the opportunity to teach under the guidance of <a href="https://sharif.edu/~hmirian/">Dr. Seyed-Hassan Mirian-Hosseinabadi</a>, an adjunct at my university and a professor at <strong>Sharif University of Technology</strong>, widely regarded as Iran’s leading engineering institution. I am deeply committed to high-impact, meaningful research and aspire to contribute actively to the academic community at the <strong>Ph.D. level</strong>.
